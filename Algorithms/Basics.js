/*
what is an algorithm:
a set of steps or instructions for completeing a task

Efficiency ->
1. Time Complexity - how much time it is taking to complete the task
2. Space Complexity - how much memory is taken up by computer to complete the task

Alogithms Definition
-> the steps in the alogirthm need to be in a very specific order
-> the steps also need to be destinct
-> the algorithm should produce a result
-> the algorithm shuld complete in a finite amount of time
